# WinProcessMemoryMadeEasy

This is a class library which allows users to read and modify external processes virtual memory space, without needing to go to deep into
windows internals.

The idea is to have a DLL, which allows users, to read and write straight off an external application's memory address space,
without having to go through the steep learning curve of windows internals, thereby handling most of the complex stuff for you.

Usage and examples can be found on the \Examples folder.

More examples will be added later on.
